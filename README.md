# Wow Meow

This project is currently only used as a release page and the code has not been open sourced yet. Currently, only Android and Windows versions are available and you can download them by clicking on "Release".

This project was developed to meet my own needs, so updates may be slow.

### Next todo
- [ ] A complete template library
- [ ] Commonly used tool library (image generation, file translation ...)
- [ ] Support for Azure TTS
- [x] Support for Google TTS

If you have any questions, you can submit an issue.
